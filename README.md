# Metagenomics at the EBI #
## working name "MGportal" ##

## Introduction ##
### What's metagenomics? ###

The study of all genomes present in any given environment without the need for prior individual identification or amplification is termed metagenomics. For example, in its simplest form a metagenomic study might be the direct sequence results of DNA extracted from a bucket of sea water.

### What is the EBI doing for metagenomic researchers? ###

The EBI resources of the European Nucleotide Archive (in particular Sequence Read Archive and EMBL-Bank), UniProt, InterPro, Ensembl Genomes and IntAct are all used for analysis by metagenomic researchers, but not in an integrated manner. We intend to provide a user friendly interface to these services, promoting their utility in the field of metagenomics. It will enable protein prediction, function analysis, comparison to complete reference genomes and metabolic pathway analysis.

## This Project ##
The code here will include everything that has been generated to fulfill the above criteria, including the design of the [web portal](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/) to submit and browse data.

MGportal is being developed as an open source project at EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI).

## The web portal ##
The web portal is under development. Please visit us to see the latest version on http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/.
