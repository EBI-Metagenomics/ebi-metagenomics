submitView.title=Submit data
#submitView.introduction=We currently provide a manually-supported submission service. After registering, you will be asked to send us a summary of your data using an online form. You will then be contacted by our curation team to enable submission of your data to our analysis pipeline and to the underlying archive (SRA). Our curators will translate your data and metadata to the required formats and provide you with accession numbers that you can use for publication purposes, and a direct link to your analysis results (note, depending on the size of your submission, the analysis may take a few days to complete).
#submitView.introduction.part1=We provide a manually-supported service for submission of sequence data and associated metadata to the nucleotide archives (SRA) and our analysis pipelines. To submit data, you need to register first.
#submitView.introduction.part2= the latest version of a spreadsheet (current version 5.2) to capture your metadata and then submit it via the webform below. You will subsequently be contacted with directions to a secure upload location to send us your sequence data files.
#submitView.introduction.part3=After successful submission of both metadata and data files we will provide you with accession numbers that can be used for publication purposes, and a direct link to your analysis results (note, depending on the size of your submission, the analysis may take a few days to complete).

submitView.introduction.part1=We provide a service for submission of sequence data and associated metadata to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and our analysis pipelines. To submit data and access the results of the analysis of your data, you need to log in with your European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) username and password. If you are a new user, please register with us first. Currently, you will also need an account with the ENA Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/sra_submissions) to access the SRA Webin submission system. Please contact datasubs@ebi.ac.uk <mailto:datasubs@ebi.ac.uk> to request a submission account. We hope to implement a single login for both accounts in the near future.

submitView.introduction.part2=The SRA Webin submission system (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/) has recently been adapted to support the submission of shotgun and amplicon metagenomics studies and capture associated metadata. It may be worth pointing out that we require detailed descriptions of spots (including any adapters, barcodes and primers). We recommend that new users view the instruction video (http://youtu.be/Zml8jTqfQPg) first.

submitView.introduction.part3=After successful submission of both metadata and data files we will provide you with accession numbers that can be used for publication purposes, and a direct link to your analysis results (note, depending on the size of your submission, the analysis may take some time to complete).

submitView.introduction.part4=We provide a service for submission of sequence data and associated metadata to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and our analysis pipelines. To submit data and access the results of the analysis of your data, you need to log in with your ENA EMBL-Bank account (see below).
submitView.introduction.part6=The SRA Webin submission system (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/) has recently been adapted to support the submission of shotgun and amplicon metagenomics studies and capture associated metadata.

sraRegistrationForm.introduction.part1=Currently, you will also need an ENA Sequence Read Archive (SRA) account to access the
sraRegistrationForm.introduction.part2=. Please fill in all the required fields below to apply for an SRA account and submit it to use. We hope to implement a single login for both accounts in the near future.
