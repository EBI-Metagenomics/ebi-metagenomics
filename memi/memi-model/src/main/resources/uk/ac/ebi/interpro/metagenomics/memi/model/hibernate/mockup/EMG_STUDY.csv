We have used shotgun metagenome sequencing to provide a survey of the microbial community and potential metabolic pathways present in the tropical rain forest soil of Puerto Rico. Wet tropical forest soils are some of the most productive and diverse terrestrial ecosystems on earth. These soils are characterized by high iron concentrations and regular fluctuations between oxic and anoxic conditions on a scale of days to weeks. These dynamic conditions suggest that bacterial and archaeal processes are more important in this type of environment than in other ecosystems."

We have previously generated a six year time series from L4 that showed that the bacterial community shows strong seasonal structuring and diversity peaks every year on the winter solstice.  Here we further confirm this pattern by extending this study to include genes and transcripts generated for eight additional time points in 2008.  This data includes further 16S datasets as well as eight metagenomes (1.2 GB) and eight metatranscriptomes (157MB).  These time points cover three seasons (Jan, April and August) and include day and night (diel) publicSamples.  In addition, the August publicSamples (4) include 4 consecutive samplings within 24 hours at six hour intervals.  Using these data we test whether Archaea also show the same observed seasonal patterns and whether these patterns hold true at the gene (functional) level. Analysis of this combined data set allows five main conclusions to be drawn.  First, Archaea show evidence of following the same seasonal patterns as Bacteria, but have ~6% the richness.  Second, for both Bacteria and Archaea, we confirm that higher 16S diversity reflects higher diversity at the gene-level (including expressed genes) and this diversity also peaks at the winter solstice. Third, interestingly, detectable diversity appears to be higher at night, and this is of special potential relevance as there is more diversity in winter when nights are longer.  Fourth, despite the diversity of these communities, night and day publicSamples taken using Lagrangian (drift) sampling were successful in isolating the same community suggesting communities are more structured than is commonly believed. Finally, this data, as expected, contains a large proportion of orphan genes without known homologues.  When compared to the housekeeping genes identified through SEED subsystem classification, these unknown genes appear to be driving the differences between publicSamples across seasons.  This underscores the importance of determining the functions of more of these sequences in the future. In summary, this study further confirms the strong seasonal patterns characterizing both the bacterial and archaeal communities at this important marine site.  The finding that, despite the huge diversity of these communities, there are evident signs of predictable patterns and detectable stability over time provides compelling evidence that renewed efforts should be focused on finding deterministic patterns in even the most complex microbial communities. The Western Channel Observatory maintains more than 100 years of continual environmental monitoring, including oceanographic and biological measures. At PML we are committed to developing this outstanding time series to include the most up to date techniques available. Our aim is to provide an holistic ecologically relevant dataset that can be used to inform environmental models and help with prediction of the impact that climate change will have on the coastal seas of the United Kingdom. With further development and comparative publicStudies this information can help to inform on global marine environments. To this end we have been employing the latest in high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate the microbial diversity and community function in this ecosystem. The technologies applied include 16S rDNA tag-pyrosequencing to deep sequence microbial diversity, as well as total community metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. This initial study includes 16S rDNA tag sequencing data for bacteria and archaeal groups as well as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics all performed on the GS-flx titanium platform using techniques outlined in Gilbert et al (2009 – Environmental Microbiology) and Gilbert et al (2008 – PloS One.) We will continue to add to this repository to maintain the temporal analysis of this community."
