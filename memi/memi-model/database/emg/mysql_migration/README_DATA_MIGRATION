    GSC_CV_CV

7. For the other tables email and ask Conor to give you an PostgreSQL data export dump which will contain columns of data type CLOB as well

    a)
    From this data export dump use the insert statements for the following tables:

        publication
        variable_names
        pipeline_release
        study_publication
        study

    ... and find and replace ,E' by ,'
    ... and find and replace (E' by ('
    ... also find and replace "INSERT INTO publication" by "INSERT INTO PUBLICATION" (simply upper case table name)
    ... also find and replace "INSERT INTO variable_names" by "INSERT INTO VARIABLE_NAMES" (simply upper case table name)
    ... also find and replace "INSERT INTO pipeline_release" by "INSERT INTO PIPELINE_RELEASE" (simply upper case table name)
    ... also find and replace "INSERT INTO study_publication" by "INSERT INTO STUDY_PUBLICATION"
    ... also find and replace "INSERT INTO study" by "INSERT INTO STUDY"
    ... also find and replace "study_study_id,publications_pub_id" by "study_id,pub_id"

    b) For the following tables create individual SQL scripts

        SAMPLE, SAMPLE_PUBLICATION (1 script)
        SAMPLE_ANN (1 script)
        ANALYSIS_JOB (1 script)


        ... and find and replace ,E' by ,'
        ... and find and replace (E' by ('
        ... also find and replace "sample_sample_id,publications_pub_id" by "sample_id,pub_id"
        ... also find and replace "INSERT INTO sample_publication" by "INSERT INTO SAMPLE_PUBLICATION"
        ... also find and replace "INSERT INTO sample" by "INSERT INTO SAMPLE"
        ... also find and replace "INSERT INTO analysis_job" by "INSERT INTO ANALYSIS_JOB"
        ... also find and replace "INSERT INTO sample_ann" by "INSERT INTO SAMPLE_ANN"




8. Put all insert statements for the following tables into 1 SQL script (in order)

    ANALYSIS_STATUS
    EXPERIMENT_TYPE
    BIOME_HIERARCHY_TREE
    PIPELINE_RELEASE
    PIPELINE_TOOL
    PIPELINE_RELEASE_TOOL
    PUBLICATION
    VARIABLE_NAMES
    GSC_CV_CV
    STUDY
    STUDY_PUBLICATION

9. Run the statements as follow:

    c) In the mysql shell call:
