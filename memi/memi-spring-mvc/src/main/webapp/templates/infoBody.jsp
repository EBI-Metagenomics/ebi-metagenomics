    <h3>What's metagenomics?</h3>

    <p>The study of all genomes present in any given environment without the need for prior individual identification or
        amplification is termed metagenomics. For example, in its simplest form a metagenomic study might be the direct
        sequence results of DNA extracted from a bucket of sea water.</p>

    <h3>What is the EBI doing for metagenomic researchers?</h3>

    <p>The EBI resources of the European Nucleotide Archive (in particular Sequence Read Archive and EMBL-Bank),
        UniProt, InterPro, Ensembl Genomes and IntAct are all used for analysis by metagenomic researchers, but not in
        an integrated manner. We intend to provide a user friendly interface to these services, promoting their utility
        in the field of metagenomics. It will enable protein prediction, function analysis, comparison to complete
        reference genomes and metabolic pathway analysis. </p>
