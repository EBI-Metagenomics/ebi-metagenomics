#submitView.introduction=We currently provide a manually-supported submission service. After registering, you will be asked to send us a summary of your data using an online form. You will then be contacted by our curation team to enable submission of your data to our analysis pipeline and to the underlying archive (SRA). Our curators will translate your data and metadata to the required formats and provide you with accession numbers that you can use for publication purposes, and a direct link to your analysis results (note, depending on the size of your submission, the analysis may take a few days to complete).
submitView.introduction.part1=We provide a manually-supported service for submission of sequence data and associated metadata to the nucleotide archives (SRA) and our analysis pipelines. To submit data, you need to register first.
submitView.introduction.part2= the latest version of a spreadsheet (current version 5.2) to capture your metadata and then submit it via the webform below. You will subsequently be contacted with directions to a secure upload location to send us your sequence data files.
submitView.introduction.part3=After successful submission of both metadata and data files we will provide you with accession numbers that can be used for publication purposes, and a direct link to your analysis results (note, depending on the size of your submission, the analysis may take a few days to complete).

submitView.warning.christmas=NOTICE: Please continue with your submission request, but be aware that due to the festive season there will be no response to emails or submission requests between Dec 16th 2011 and January 3rd 2012 inclusive. Outstanding requests will be dealt with as soon as possible when we return in 2012.
submitView.warning.restriction=Presently, analysis is restricted to "long" (average reads lengths over 200nt), unassembled sequence reads, i.e. Roche 454 sequences, from metagenomic or metatranscriptomic samples.
