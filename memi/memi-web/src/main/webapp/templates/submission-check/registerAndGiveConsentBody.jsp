                submit pre-publication data for analysis, which is to be held as confidential, we need consent to access
                your data in accordance with ENAâ€™s policies. By keeping this box checked, you consent to the EBI
                Metagenomics team analysing your private data. Note that the data, as well as the analysis results, will
                remain confidential until the release date you specify when submitting your sequencing study. You also
                confirm that the data submitted through this account is NOT sensitive, restricted-access or
                human-identifiable.
