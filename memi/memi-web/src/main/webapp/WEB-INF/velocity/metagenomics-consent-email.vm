    <p>
        Thank you for registering your Webin account $submitter.submissionAccountId with EBI
        Metagenomics. We are now able to analyse publicly available data and data held privately for pre-publication
        associated with this account.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next stage of the process requires your account to be manually updated in ENA, which may involve a short
        delay. In the meantime, you can submit your data directly to the ENA via Webin
        (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sra/#home), but your account may not yet appear activated on EBI Metagenomics
        resource.
