SRS009922,SRP001743,Puerto_Rico_Rainforest_soil_metagenome,"Soil metagenome extracted from rainforest soil. The tropical forest soil sample used for metagenome sequencing was collected in a subtropical lower montane wet forest in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (18.30N, 65.83W), which is part of the NSF-sponsored Long-Term Ecological Research program in Puerto Rico. The climate in this region is relatively aseasonal, with mean annual rainfall of 4500 mm and mean annual temperatures of 22C to 24C. Soils were collected from the Bisley watershed approximately 250 meters above sea level from the 0-10 cm depth using a 2.5 cm diameter soil corer.
